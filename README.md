#### Shallow - Missile Command
```
It's been 10 days
And you're still playing that game
So tear it apart (away)
And tear me apart on another day
Don't put me aside
Out of your way
Your head's in a daze
From walking around in that maze
So put it aside (away)
And put me aside on another day
Just put it aside
Out of your way
Growing up you spent
Your days playing Atari
But I would like to think
That you still remember me
So tear it apart (away)
And tear me apart on another day
Don't put me aside
Out of your way
Yeah, you're flying fast
But I think you're off your track
So put it aside (away)
And put me aside on another day
Just put it aside
Out of your way
Now Missile Command
Is put away under your bed
But I think that you're still playing it
Inside of your head
```
